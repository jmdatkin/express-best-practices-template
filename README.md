# Express Best Practices Template

A modular and maintainable template demonstrating best practices in a simple Express.js app. See [https://tinyurl.com/4ykn8m9f](https://tinyurl.com/4ykn8m9f) for the full guide.

# Features
## Directory Structure üìÅ
Files are organized into **services** and **routers**.
+ Services abstract the database connection from the rest of the application.
+ Routers deal with extracting data from `req` and validating it.

## External Dependencies ‚öôÔ∏è
The `better-sqlite3` database client is initialized in its own file. This has several benefits:
+ Avoids clutter in `index.ts`.
+ Provides a dedicated file for additional config/setup if necessary.
+ Provides a centralized location for other modules to import the database client.

## Clean `index.ts` ‚ú®
`index.ts` is left lightweight and is dedicated solely to bootstrapping the Express application.
Middleware and routers can be added and removed and the file remains readable and organized.

## TypeScript ‚ù§Ô∏è
Uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety and code auto-complete (if you're not using TypeScript in your projects... use TypeScript).
